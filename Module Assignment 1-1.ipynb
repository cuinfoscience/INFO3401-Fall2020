    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "This is one of two required sub-assignments for Module Assignment 1. In this assignment we want to evaluate how you can complete a data analysis on your own. This notebook will be due before midnight (11:59pm) on Friday, September 11 by submission to canvas.\n",

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Representatives elected to the U.S. House are given budgets to hire staff and to run their offices in Washington, D.C. as well as in their home district. Senior leadership offices and committees also receive budgets to hire their own staff and conduct their business. These funds cannot be used for personal or campaign expenses and there is no reserve fund if members run over budget. These budgets vary across members and committees  and depend on a variety of factors. Detailed records of these disbursements are [published quarterly as CSV files](https://www.house.gov/the-house-explained/open-government/statement-of-disbursements/archive) going back to 2010.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to also check out the [Details](https://www.house.gov/the-house-explained/open-government/statement-of-disbursements/details), [FAQ](https://www.house.gov/the-house-explained/open-government/statement-of-disbursements/frequently-asked-questions), [Glossary](https://www.house.gov/the-house-explained/open-government/statement-of-disbursements/glossary-of-terms), and [Transaction Codes](https://www.house.gov/the-house-explained/open-government/statement-of-disbursements/transaction-codes).  Disappointingly as both an information scientist and a citizen, the Senate does not publish analgous kinds of office disbursement data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more optional background, also check out the [cleaned data](https://projects.propublica.org/represent/expenditures), [blog posts](https://www.propublica.org/article/update-on-house-disbursements-a-few-notes-on-how-to-use-the-data), [training resources](https://www.propublica.org/documents/item/3230540-75012825-House-Disbursements-Reports-Training.html), and stories about [budget reductions](https://www.propublica.org/article/house-operating-budget-cuts-paving-way-for-more-special-interest-influence) and [staff turnover](https://www.propublica.org/article/turnover-in-the-house-who-keeps-and-who-loses-the-most-staff) the ProPublic/Sunlight Foundation publishes about these data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook follows Chapter 4 in Peng and Matsui *[The Art of Data Science](https://canvas.colorado.edu/courses/62560/files/19782496)* (available under Week 01 on Canvas) if you want more background."
